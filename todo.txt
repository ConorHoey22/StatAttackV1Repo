FUTURE developments - FRONTEND 
https://codepen.io/paulnoble/pen/PwOxOY
3D pitch and line up like Skysports or on Tv

-------------Bugs that occur in development
-- IF touchobacity/button is not responsive apply  position: 'absolute', to style of the object
-- When in stats app - detailed analsis i cant undo the field with plots with the start button



TASKS To be looked at 
--SportType within Viewgame should be got from the team record and we need to find a alternative to myuserid
-- View each page/screen as a player and another TA as the HEAD team analyst USER ID is needed for it all so we need to solve this

-- test need / patch maybe needed = So what if the Opponent in that game doesnt have an events 
and then the user trys to see the users stats -- What do they see?


-- NEDD TO LOCK APP TO LANDSCAPE

TEST GFI

--TODAYs TASKs------------------------------------



  --Opponents  field selection and View Games Opponents

  -- REVIEW GAME BUG in individual it displays field

  -- review game Stats app - field positions (PC and tablet will be fine but i think mobile will be an issue 
      - We will have to put an alert saying review field location mode is unavailable for mobile , so maybe if screenwidth == .. or screenheight then opeiton is not displayed)




  --Stats app
   // Percentages - DISABLEd THIS AS BUG
    -- UNDO event button
    --Stats app -  FIX needed GAA doesnt have event History or Event Patterns where Soccer mode does
    Bug - With delete a game - gameobj.screenwidth


Training mode - stats app needs implemented in setup and stats app itself

--Opponents ViewGame needs implemented now
--View a specific player stats (VIEW GAME)
--view game back button for field image view

--setupstatsapp --  Make sure that the user must select 15/11 players for the starting team as 
-- the counter increments with subbench selection which is an issue as what if u only select a subbench


--sTats app - Field tagging
-- When using a mobile its hard to plot points at the top as the controlpanel container and when the user clicks there 
or beside it it can go off the field. COuld we create a boundary like unresponsive if you click that area or responsive if you click the button to undo event
so like on Fieldselection start button and other buttons expect undo button is removed 





currently working on soccermode for stats app - Scoreboard we are at // line 6312

review an individual player - front end bug 


when you click review game buttons - NOthing is responsive , we had this issue before - look above absolute position needed i think
  --review game - detail - your team - review teame events and field locations - Select an event appears - hit Start - selection does not disappear




----- Stats app 5% for a undo button
----- viewGame needs a Soccer mode - currently on this , its not responsive as  i would like as the image gets cut off unlike the GAA on , maybe we need a bigger image same as GAA one
  -- current issue is when your using a small device - mobile , its not responsive , think it may be stats app
--Event history and patterns in STATS app both gAa and soccer


Test 1 - Stats app using tablet view game using tablet , PC , mobile) - PASS
       - Try more unique position like goal-lines - FAIL - PLot was not displayed in Viewgame
          --Test in Game Review game and View Game

Test 2 - Stats app using PC view game using PC , tablet,  mobile) FAIL - 1 plot failed on the far left
      - Try more unique position like goal-lines

Test 3 - Stats app using Mobile view game using  mobile , tablet,  PC) - PASS BUT FRONTend fail on Mobile 
       - Try more unique position like goal-lines


       --boundary so like an outer border around the Field images
       - issue may be because of a of the touch obacity , as on tablet the bottom //side lines are not 




      FIX test------ GAA Image
      Test 1 - Stats app using tablet view game using tablet , PC , mobile) 
          result: Tablet Pass - PC PASS - Mobile Fail(Points were off)

      Test 2 - Stats app using PC view game using PC , tablet,  mobile)
           result: Tablet Pass - PC PASS - Mobile Fail(Points were off)

      Test 3 - Stats app using Mobile view game using  mobile , tablet,  PC) 
          result: Mobile - Pass , Tablet Pass - PC PASS

      FIX test------ Soccer Image
      Test 1 - Stats app using tablet view game using tablet , PC , mobile) 
      Test 2 - Stats app using PC view game using PC , tablet,  mobile)
      Test 3 - Stats app using Mobile view game using  mobile , tablet,  PC) 



--------- NEED TO RE DEVELOP this game -- SCROLLVIEW DOESNT WORK anymore

     issue right now is that mobile view as we have a nav bar which means the image is not fully displayed pn mobile


    alert needs to be closed / removed as it re pops up again if u leave it to long open

     -- RISK ACCEPTANCE -- Mobile version its never going to be pin point as the device can be very small. 



--------------------------------- ALL USERS --------------------------------------

RESET THEIR password  OR Email??
CHANGE PASSWORD



----------------- Player Mode -----------------------------------

   
--SportType within Viewgame should be got from the team record and we need to find a alternative to myuserid
  -- MyTeam - need to pass the Team ID to the Player user account 
  -- So once the user enters in their invitecode+teaminvitecode and its a match then add the TeamID to their record

--What if a player wants to leave a team
  -- we need to remove the TeamID value 
  -- Need to remove the player from team/Players collection? ,, will the team lose data on this player then tho? that will be an issue

--what if a player wants to join a new team


-- View the entire app as a player what can they access , make a list a test
  --

-- View the entire app as a Team analsyt what can they access , make a list a test
  -- Can they use the stats app?
  -- Can they add players to the team?
  --  --only allow the HeadTeamAdmin delete game

-- View the entire app as a HeadTeam analsyt what can they access , make a list a test
  -- MyTeam could be like only editable for HEAd TEAM analsyt
     -- where is View my Team could be for players/team analsyt -- READ ONLY
     --  --only allow the HeadTeamAdmin delete game

------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------- Team analyst Mode (THis is not the same as HeadTeamAdmin as they create the team etc) --------------------------------

-- We need to allow the team analyst to have the ability to add new players 

-- setupstatsapp access and submittion

-- Stats app access and submittion

--everything that the HeadTeamAdmin can do i think 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------


------------------------------------- HeadTeamAdmin mode -----------------------------------------------


-- Access / Permissions Settings for HeadTeamAdmin

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------





  //Soccer EnD GAME Logic needed

  ---PLAyer has the ability to view their stats from a specific game- also USER RECORD
          --USER
              --Event
                  --GAMEID
                  -- Opponents Name
                    -- Position they played






  -- Soccer needs updated also (just the frontend)
  --touches
-- Unique stats - that not normal for some apps - location 
-- App / Web version for field selection prob may need different images - TEST this as web looks badly







FOR THE DEMO 
--change setupstatsapp so that they have to enter 15 or 11
-- PLAYERS CANT VIEW THEIR Own TEAM YET 
-- TEAM analsyt cant either only HeadTeamAdmin 
-- THERE IS LIMITED EVENTS IN STATS APP AS I HAVENT CODED THEM IN YET AS I NEEDED CONFIRMATION ON IF THEY ARE RIGHT FIRST
-- onlY GOALS I THINK IS WORKINK AND SUB PLAYER
-- event patterns only occurs >=4
-- WE ALSO NEED THE LENGTH OF TIME THE PLAYED, SO SAY THE PLAYER GETS SUBBED OFF RECORD THAT LENGTH OF TIME HE PLAYED

--GET better images for field selection ?

----Soccer mode needs fully tested and prob will need an update within Stats App

//currently only implemented in the db and logic
            totalGoals: firebase.database.ServerValue.increment(Goals),
                            totalShots: firebase.database.ServerValue.increment(Shots),
                            totalShotsOnTarget: firebase.database.ServerValue.increment(ShotsOnTarget)

-- test  SubOnPlayer  = async() => { ------ DOes this do anything?

--DO GAA HAVE SHOTS on target?


WE ARe here
Join team problem below
so  to join a team you need the team ID so its the HeadTeamAdmin USERID which will then allow the user to join that team.
So we could make it that the player needs to ask the HeadTeamAdmin to give their userId to them. 
HTA will then need a way to find them - Maybe put this on the Manageteam




//Is there a way to remove the android nav bar?

// - event Patterns not working - need to double check that 


// Clean up job of unused code and DB fields


/// -- Detailed anaysis within stats app

/// SOCCER mode needs to have a Opponents mode


// Yellow warning on device 

/ style warnings on the Console - look at web

-- ensure that the app cant go portrait


-------------exceptions needed
-- invalid Team invite code exception for - existing player accounts reg
-- exception for invalid teaminvite and player invitecode
-- badly formatted email and already in use email


--THIs WEEKEnd
--NEW PLAYER ACCOUNT BUG - we need them to specify the SPORT as its needed for MyProfile

-- new player needs the ability to JOIN A TEAM 



STATS App
--STAT holder needs to store plot coorinates and store in DB of each event  
 think as then post game you can view where all the stats occured
        --First step - after Event Selection , make plotfield appear  
        --On plot selection then send to  ObtainFieldPositionSelected function which has execute
  





















---------SUPER USER CREATION -- -
do we create this manually by altering the DB once we go LIVE




What if the player wants to keep his account and leave to join a new team
-- Teams/players account would need to remove the USERID and replace with random include

What if the Team admin deletes the user from the account , what happens when the user trys to view MYTeam
