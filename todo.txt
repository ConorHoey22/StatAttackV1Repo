FUTURE developments - FRONTEND 
https://codepen.io/paulnoble/pen/PwOxOY
3D pitch and line up like Skysports or on Tv
-- removing TA privaleges - 1account for as my users - this will be test on deployment




-------------Bugs that occur in development-----------
-- IF touchobacity/button is not responsive apply  position: 'absolute', to style of the object
-- When in stats app - detailed analsis i cant undo the field with plots with the start button



currently working on 
**- Opponents field selection and View Games Opponents (TEST if it only shows opponent events not the other team) **
  -=-improve Frontend and test on different devices 
  --Starting with Website and work are way down to smaller devices

  - sub a player 
- need to save how long they played subded on and off player  ----- how to calculate the minutes played line 983

TASKS To be looked at 
- sign up as player - Existing we want it to navigate to Login (CANT get this to work  . tried alert)
- More Stats

- Training mode - stats app needs implemented in setup and stats app itself
- REVIEW GAME BUG in individual it displays field - STATS APP SCREEN
- review game Stats app - field positions (PC and tablet will be fine but i think mobile will be an issue 
    -- We will have to put an alert saying review field location mode is unavailable for mobile , so maybe if screenwidth == .. or screenheight then opeiton is not displayed)
-- Percentages within stats app , View game and Team Profile and then Player Profile also - DISABLEd THIS AS BUG
-- Player Profile / Player View - need a list of things we want to show them 
    --Team Profile
    -- their own profile with stats + Percentages
    -- Can they view other teammates Percentages??



RISK ACCEPTANCE features
--Mobile version its never going to be pin point as the device can be very small. 
        --issue right now is that mobile view as we have a nav bar which means the image is not fully displayed pn mobile




Bugs
-- possibly A Bug in sub (Your team ) - try do it really fast

-- View Game (Field position) Frontend needs to far better 
-What we want is like a white background around the field and more nice looking 


    //How to delete a user safely. as deleting A HeadTeamAdmin would not be good as it would corrupt the team record?

  


    Bug - With delete a game - gameobj.screenwidth
    --sub a player -- need to save how long they played subded on and off player


--Opponents ViewGame needs implemented now
--View a specific player stats (VIEW GAME)
--view game back button for field image view

--setupstatsapp --  Make sure that the user must select 15/11 players for the starting team as 
-- the counter increments with subbench selection which is an issue as what if u only select a subbench

review an individual player - front end bug 







--------




--------------------------------- ALL USERS --------------------------------------

RESET THEIR password  OR Email??
CHANGE PASSWORD

     -- risk Acceptance -- We need to test this out once we fully deploy -- 1 HeadTeamAdmin account will be used by other staff on the team 
     -  We need to test this when the app is deployed to check if we can have 2 stats app games running at same time and both logined into the same account



----------------- Player Mode -----------------------------------

   
--SportType within Viewgame should be got from the team record and we need to find a alternative to myuserid
  -- MyTeam - need to pass the Team ID to the Player user account 
  -- So once the user enters in their invitecode+teaminvitecode and its a match then add the TeamID to their record

--What if a player wants to leave a team
  -- we need to remove the TeamID value 
  -- Need to remove the player from team/Players collection? ,, will the team lose data on this player then tho? that will be an issue

--what if a player wants to join a new team


-- View the entire app as a player what can they access , make a list a test
  --

-- View the entire app as a Team analsyt what can they access , make a list a test
  -- Can they use the stats app?
  -- Can they add players to the team?
  --  --only allow the HeadTeamAdmin delete game

-- View the entire app as a HeadTeam analsyt what can they access , make a list a test
  -- MyTeam could be like only editable for HEAd TEAM analsyt
     -- where is View my Team could be for players/team analsyt -- READ ONLY
     --  --only allow the HeadTeamAdmin delete game

------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------- Team analyst Mode (THis is not the same as HeadTeamAdmin as they create the team etc) --------------------------------

-- We need to allow the team analyst to have the ability to add new players 

-- setupstatsapp access and submittion

-- Stats app access and submittion

--everything that the HeadTeamAdmin can do i think 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------


------------------------------------- HeadTeamAdmin mode -----------------------------------------------

  //Soccer EnD GAME Logic needed

  ---PLAyer has the ability to view their stats from a specific game- also USER RECORD
          --USER
              --Event
                  --GAMEID
                  -- Opponents Name
                    -- Position they played






  -- Soccer needs updated also (just the frontend)
  --touches
-- Unique stats - that not normal for some apps - location 
-- App / Web version for field selection prob may need different images - TEST this as web looks badly







FOR THE DEMO 
--change setupstatsapp so that they have to enter 15 or 11
-- PLAYERS CANT VIEW THEIR Own TEAM YET 
-- TEAM analsyt cant either only HeadTeamAdmin 
-- THERE IS LIMITED EVENTS IN STATS APP AS I HAVENT CODED THEM IN YET AS I NEEDED CONFIRMATION ON IF THEY ARE RIGHT FIRST
-- onlY GOALS I THINK IS WORKINK AND SUB PLAYER
-- event patterns only occurs >=4
-- WE ALSO NEED THE LENGTH OF TIME THE PLAYED, SO SAY THE PLAYER GETS SUBBED OFF RECORD THAT LENGTH OF TIME HE PLAYED

--GET better images for field selection ?

----Soccer mode needs fully tested and prob will need an update within Stats App

//currently only implemented in the db and logic
            totalGoals: firebase.database.ServerValue.increment(Goals),
                            totalShots: firebase.database.ServerValue.increment(Shots),
                            totalShotsOnTarget: firebase.database.ServerValue.increment(ShotsOnTarget)

-- test  SubOnPlayer  = async() => { ------ DOes this do anything?

--DO GAA HAVE SHOTS on target?


WE ARe here
Join team problem below
so  to join a team you need the team ID so its the HeadTeamAdmin USERID which will then allow the user to join that team.
So we could make it that the player needs to ask the HeadTeamAdmin to give their userId to them. 
HTA will then need a way to find them - Maybe put this on the Manageteam




//Is there a way to remove the android nav bar?

// - event Patterns not working - need to double check that 


// Clean up job of unused code and DB fields


/// -- Detailed anaysis within stats app

/// SOCCER mode needs to have a Opponents mode


// Yellow warning on device 

/ style warnings on the Console - look at web

-- ensure that the app cant go portrait


-------------exceptions needed
-- invalid Team invite code exception for - existing player accounts reg
-- exception for invalid teaminvite and player invitecode
-- badly formatted email and already in use email



























---------SUPER USER CREATION -- -
do we create this manually by altering the DB once we go LIVE




What if the player wants to keep his account and leave to join a new team
-- Teams/players account would need to remove the USERID and replace with random include

What if the Team admin deletes the user from the account , what happens when the user trys to view MYTeam
