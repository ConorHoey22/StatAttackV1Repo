// ---------------------------------------RISK Acceptance-------------------------------------------
    // The odds of the team having the same userid within this very low as you can only have 30 players
    // when you sub a player the selected player is automatically put on the list this isnt a huge issue

     -- RISK ACCEPTANCE -- Mobile version its never going to be pin point as the device can be very small. 

     -- Risk Acceptance -- no back bottom for mobile as its uses the full screen for the image , 
     odds on users not being able to go back is silm as android u can click back button 
     , its more apple i am unsure about 
     
     -- risk Acceptance -- We need to test this out once we fully deploy -- 1 HeadTeamAdmin account will be used by other staff on the team 
     -  We need to test this when the app is deployed to check if we can have 2 stats app games running at same time and both logined into the same account

------------------ How to create A Team Admin  + Assign it to a team ------------------------------

First the Super User must create the HeadTeamAdmin Account 
  -- Then the HeadTeamAdmin will CREATE THEIR TEAM and assign a team admin invite code

The super User will create the team admin accounts
 -- the team admin will then login and navigate to join a team and enter the team admin invite code

Once the Team admin enters the team invitecode  
  - there USERID will be added under the team Record which can then be obtained in other parts of the system and give them access to the stats app



---------------- MORE USER Friendly Setup Stats App ----------------------------------------- DONE

  -- First the user i asked to enter the Opponenets Name 
      -- onSubmit  Next stage or if empty then prompt user
  
  -- User is asked to select starting 11/15 and SubBench as it is normally done 
    -- User is asked to select Opponents starting 11//15 and SubBench as it is normally done 
  
  -- Once user submits one player for their team or Opponents the ability to view Teamsheet appears
   --DElete a player all ready capable- i think this just needs to improved design of the list 

  --Once user has selected 11 or 15 players , the ability to Submit team selection appear(Process to stats APP)

How to Delete a user safely 
-- Create if there USERID is assigned to a stat/ Team CreatedByUserID



  --------------------HOW TO ADD A STAT-----------------------------
  //To create a stats you need to go to ObtainFieldPositionSelected , 
  then in the IF STATEMENT you copy the condition with what the eventTYpe is 
  and then conditon with the selectedPlayer 
  which considers if its the opponenets or Yourteam
  *WHEN WE ARE GOING TO ADD ALL THE STATS CHECK THEM ALL , OpponentsNEED AN execute function*

  --Things to update
    -End Game backend - db totals
    -Event Selection frontend&back
    -total team stats , front&back
    -total Opponents stats , front&back
    -Player Profile, front&back
    -Team Profile, front&back
    =Detailed analysis, front&back
    -ObtainFieldPositionSelected
    -executegoal etc


  -- How do we send field location of each event to the database , do we have multiple fields / rows created?
  -- COuld we store it all into one array and store the array value in the Firebase Db and then on the app filter the array to display data
