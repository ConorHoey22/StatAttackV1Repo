Firebase 
-- Updating firebase can sometimes result in functions not working
-- uninstall it 
-- reinstall it is all you can do. npm install firebase , check updates for versions


Bugs 
--UI Validation for Player registeration, cannot get invaild invite and teaminvitecode alerts to appear
--Create a Team - cant select Soccer 
-- UI Validation Adding a Player - CANT use the alert  as it will create 2 players??
=ON Expo Mobile, if the user selects a email from the reccommended list , it crashes app. 
USER MUST ENTER THE EMAIL
-- WHEN USER ENTER INCORRECT PASSWORd (on Mobile) ERROR APPEARS
CANt use auto populate on login screen as it wont recognise you actually enter somehting


//Possble BUG to look out for - perfrom a goal and then close the app - Create a new game with same player with same number then
 executegoal - StartingArray still saved and keeps goal = 1 when it should be default
 // Maybe we need to ensure that onload array is removed from the data and set to 0
    //Possible Bug saves the last game as i saw it  goals = 2 when it should have only been 1 goal


 
-------------THIS NEEDS TO BE DEVELOPED ONCE/ TESTED ONCE RELEASED TO APP STORE
-- ON LOGGED IN AT ALL TIMES UNLESS YOU SIGN OUT 
-- Once ONLINE you need get all the team players so that the user can create the teamsheet OFFLINE
-- BACK UP Server data , daily!


Testing for when the APP is in the APP STORE

-- HOW will the app work. So the user will log in and obtain all the data that is need through the homescreen 
-- WE would ask the user to possibly log in before and after gmaeday / when making changes to the team roster so that they can update the database and device stored data]
-- look at the correction above , I'm not  100% on this but we will need to further test this when we have the app on the app store so that we can see what happens when the user closes the app, will the device that data? is Async storage best way to go ? 
-- We will also need to ensure that the user is constantly logged in which I cant test right not ON EXPO.


OFFLINE mode

------ MAY NEED TO SAVE Myuserid as Asyncstorage or 
-- I think you need to store all the players in Asyncstorage 
-- If the user is offline , they do not see their team members . so we need to save them in local 
-- CHECk within setupstatsapp if the generated firebase key can be obtained while offline - line 213
--COrrection - NEed to test as I go along, 
I think that so right now we obtain the all the data 
that we need to use the app by calling all firebase GET ROUTES within the HOMESCREEN 
which then i think stores on the device and used while offline

Offline capabilities
At the point when clients are disconnected from the internet, the Realtime Database SDKs employ local cache on the device to store changes. Later when the device comes online, the local data is automatically synchronized to Realtime Database. We can enable disk persistence to save the data offline from the following lines of code:

//Offline support
FirebaseDatabase.getInstance().setPersistenceEnabled(true);

 // ---------------------------------------RISK Acceptance-------------------------------------------
    // The odds of the team having the same userid within this very low as you can only have 30 players
    // when you sub a player the selected player is automatically put on the list this isnt a huge issue

     -- RISK ACCEPTANCE -- Mobile version its never going to be pin point as the device can be very small. 

     -- Risk Acceptance -- no back bottom for mobile as its uses the full screen for the image , 
     odds on users not being able to go back is silm as android u can click back button 
     , its more apple i am unsure about 


Task to be done before stats app


 Setup stats app 
//setup 
//TRAINING MODE
        /TImestamp when you created the game just for filering games in the future , not essential right now
        //DO WE NEED A COUNTER HERE FOR A MAX SUB BENCH
    //-- Validation to ensure that you cant use the same kit number


//RESEt the minimum players in setup as we have it to 3 for GAA 


//AMOUNT OF GAMES COUNTER , so you can only save 30 games to Team and then like the stats stay with the players profile tho
    





//BEFORE DEMO 
MAKE it that you must have at least 11(Soccer) 15 GAA starting player and at least 1 person on the bench at all times (So you need 1 in the subbench array within Setup) 
test layout with over 15/11 players in starting and bench

        Suggestion
        //Could we have like different alerts like ,green (good ) , yellow, amber , red for event Patterns


Current bug/tasks
StatsTable
-- Select Field postion needs sorted!

--Total team stats frontend i think you need to just move this 



----------------------------------------TASKS THAT NEED DONE TO Priority-----------------------
- Select a Field position and frontend of it (we cant do that plotting thing on mobile - what can we do) 




-- Limit to X amount of games that you can save , and also Team Profile set amount 
-- this will then be used in the setupstatsapp so u cant click Gameday until u remove a game?
-- Delete a game record - within my TeamProfile? 
-- Limit will be checked - if <1 then the button will not appear to search for the games

-- not enough players screen needs to have a button to redirect

--ManageTeam we need view players - Use frontend tool to design

-we have a demo field position as i cant seem to get the ploting working on mobile

--Reset view - without having to start the timer> - say you are at HT and then waiting for kickoff 
-- Event occured  field pattern Positions - lost the ball in this area or 10 shots on target from this array , maybe not every event needs this


Player Profiles
--we have a button on main Menu
-- Admin can view playerr Profiles from ManageTeam - This is where we send the USerID from ManageTeam to Profile page which is then used to retrieve data
--on the player profile page we get the Myuserid which on load will retrieve the related data using that id from the DB



Team Profile - review previous games (Maybe only review your own team not others??)
Scoreboard - Score can be messy looking depending on the screen size - try FLEXWRAP or increase height a bit
Successful and unsuccessful events - shots on target , off target , unsuccessful passes and all the other events  - which also includes Repeated patterns in those


--Are we able to retrieve the sportType if the user is offine?

--Bug on mobile the Opponentsbutton is not displaying correctly
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------





Current Tasks
Profiles/playercards - view other players profile by search
Undo Event after it has already executed (udeo Goal , Sub) 


-this should only appear if there is a repeat event
change PASSWORD
change email 
Legal stuff
MAke the soccer version Identical as you have to set up/if statements
Foul -yellow card, red, black card FOR GAA , yellow , red - Soccer
assist

soccer view needs fixed . there is no sub feature added  frontend


This weekend
- Select a Field position and frontend of it is Priority

    (Check does the game get submitted to FB even if user closes the app after submittion) display Total team stats , store in firebase 


    -SeTup stats app bug
        -- When the user uses up all possible players and adds them to the stats array and then trys to addPlayer again the array is empty and because of the validation we cannot proceed , if the user hits the back button it goes back to the MEnu 
        -- if the user hits the back button it goes back to the MEnu  , we need to cahnge this to go back to option Setup (page beforea)



HALF TIME -   or just
        //Stats analysis -Graphs? or just stats?

    









//Possible bug -  Start , click a player ,timer stops , clear timer without choosing an event






--Stats completed
    Goal

- event Pattern display  -- Current
    --IF Repeated eventtype = goal or pass or fouls , if it happens throughout the game 
    -- Identical eventtype and player -  lost the ball by number 7  if it happens x number of times throughout the ga


--- Display previous event on the field selection , within Post game and half time 


--- Sub player / Replace with Replacement/Subsitiution player
----------cant we have a resub on ?? or once you sub thats it ? status= Subbed
we need a way to prevent the user from resubbing the player back on ???
or maybe just leave it to allowing them to resub if they wanted to , not a big deal

-- Player selection 
    --working but what if there is a 
    3 digit number or more in a few and then like does the buttons go down the next row or off the screen.

    //how do we track Opponents stats ? or do we
    //MAKE SUre you change Setup Min teamsheet in submit Functions as we have it set up for test
    // DO WE NEED TO TAKE STATS For the Opponents TEAm ? as how will we change the playerkitnumber/Playerselection?
    //Chane code to selectedstarting11 to selectedstartingteam

PROFILES NEEDED
--Scouting Platform?
        --If clubs didnt want to share players accounts , we could draw them out with something, 2% off or something
        -- Also since the user creates the account , technically its there right to share their data , we would have to have an option whether they want to share their stats(THis should be done during registeration)






    //Disable ability to press player kit numbers after like the timer button does grey out . Be nice if we highlighted the choosen button a differnt color. instead of making it disappear

    //OnLoad of the stats app , push all stats to the relevant record so that goals will =0 in the record , we need it this way for totals

Testing needed

-- Player sign up and enter team invite code and also their player invite code 
-- This wil attach their UID to the relevant players record **
--  Make it that the TeamAdmin must set a unique teaminvitecode and unique playercode (DONE - Testing needed) 
-- with the playercodes it will only need to be unique within that team players list 
-- but for teaminvitecode it must be Completely unique within the teams list 


~DEMO THIS WEEK
    Sign up HeadAnalyst & TeamAnalyst
        -Make teaminvitecode completely unique, make it that other users can have the same
        - Ui field Validation
        - Testing 

    HeadAnalyst Creating Players(Non registered)
        -   HeadAnalyst will then create players with a max of playerlimit which is set during HeadAnalyst registeration (we create these accounts)
        -- Validation that the playerinviteCode is completely unique within the HeadAnalyst's TEAM.
        --  Testing  

    Sign up as a player 
        - UserPlayer enters teaminvitecode on Sign up (Validation needed here , if no match , still create but do notify them that )
        - User enter player invitecode on sign up (Validation needed here , if no match, still create but do notify them that ))
        - Backend wil then find a the HeadAnalyst by the matching teaminvitecode which will retrieve the HeadAnalyst UID 
        - With the HeadAnalyst UID, we then user this to find the matching team.
        - Then the backend will search within that matching team under the subfolder (/players) which will then search for the squad player created with the matching playerinviteCode
        --Then we push the UID of the now registered userplayer into the that teams players record. 

    Login
        -  Ui field Validation 
        -  Testing

    AppNavigation
        - Test as a HeadAnalyst or TeamAnalyst or Player

    ManageTeam
    -   BE able to view all players within your team and if they are registered to UserID or AppNavigation
    -   Delete a player from the squad
    -   delete the team









--Check if the user is online or offline, 
we need a way of preventing them from accessing specific pages which will just cause problems 
if they arent online

-- Offline stuff
    --Save user data to mobile so the team details and user
    -- MAKE SURE THAT THE USER KNOWs that they must come online before game day to update stuff


--Update firebase DB rules, security risk i got through email


--POST Sign UP as a player and what Stats from that player is pushed to the now registered player



Leave Team and Join a new team without creating a brand new account
-- Can we allow stats to carry on, is it needed?


Setup stats app 
 {/* list of players within the teamsheet + Sub bench list 
 A button which will remove from the bench depending 
 on what their status (Starting Team or Sub) 
 they button will display differently and return them tothe availableteamsheet


BUG
 THE bug is that from the Player selection dropdown , 
 the value we send to the backend is the key of the team/players{key}  
 ITs fine for adding but for removal we need to use the TeamsheetList/SubBenchList 
 which does not contain the PlayerName , So how will the user identify which player they are removing.
 






---MORe specific player position needed for GAA and SOccer
- Offline mode , obtain all players once you are logged on and store locally 
and then say 2 days later you are offline it wont matter as they will stay locally saved even though you have closed the APP 
    -Stats do not save to the userplayer if the gameType is Training


Stats app
-- Everything 
-- Offline mode , upload data when connection is found
    -Stats do not save to the userplayer if the gameType is Training

    --When submitting a stat it will add by either playerUIF 
    but will also send their stats to their personal account using userID
    --IF USerID = "" then use playeruid , We cannot send stats to their personal account as it does not exist yet
